  <h1>About Me:</h1>








  <div class="container">

    <div class="text">
      <p>My early passions for science and math and their intersections with 
medicine drove me to study biomedical engineering at the Georgia Institute of 
Technology. It was during an introductory biostatistics course that I fell in 
love with statistics, and knew immediately that it was something I wanted to 
study for the rest of my life. Statistics appeals to me because it combines 
all of my passions for math, computer science, and medicine like no other 
subject I have encountered. It was for this reason that I now pursue my PhD 
in Statistics at Rice University.<br><br>

        I currently conduct research under the advisement of Dr. Christine Peterson at MD 
Anderson. My current project concerns improving the quality of CT scan images taken of cancer 
patients. Computed Tomography (CT) is often used to diagnose and treat patients with cancer. 
However, CT scans are not always of ideal quality for radiologists to make accurate judgements 
for the patient. For example, if there is not enough contrast in the image, then the scan has to 
be retaken at a later date. This means another trip to the hospital for patients, more time spent 
per patient for technicians, and an overall strain on hospital resources. I have proposed and am
 currently constructing a machine learning model that can be used to predict where various venous 
structures are, so that we may measure its mean pixel value. From this, a decision can be made by 
technicians on whether or not the image is of good enough quality.
<br><br>

        My ultimate goal is to continue exploring my passion for using scientific
 and computational principles to solve pressing biomedical data problems. I 
love working with patient data, and a PhD in statistics will give me the necessary 
mathematical expertise to address the explosion of biomedical data and improve health 
outcomes across the globe in all areas of medicine. My long-term aspiration is to conduct 
independent statistics research in academia, government, or industry, so that
 I can freely explore bleeding-edge methods that have the potential to improve 
the human condition.
