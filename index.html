  <h1>About Me:</h1>








  <div class="container">

    <div class="text">
      <p>Medicine, math, and programming have always instilled a fervent passion in me that makes me certain that I
        would like to research these subjects for the rest of my life. This enthusiasm and my eagerness to always
        continue learning drove me to study biomedical engineering at Georgia Tech, where I discovered the opportunity
        to blend all of my passions into biomedical data science. <br><br>

        I currently work as a research assistant for the Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, where I use data mining,
        data processing, and predictive modeling algorithms to solve pressing biomedical problems. Last summer, I
        successfully published my first, first-author publication as an undergraduate student.<br><br>

        Through my exciting adventures in data science, I have also grown an appreciation for working with diverse teams
        to accomplish diverse set of goals. I love meeting new people and making friends, and I hope that I have the
        opportunity to keep doing so as I grow professionally.<br><br>

        I am currently searching for and applying to Statistics and Biostatistics PhD programs. These programs will help
        me leverage my biomedical engineering background to solve health problems in new and exciting ways.</p>
